PROJECT 1 :
📝 Project Description:
You will build a simple CLI-based Student Report Card system that takes student details and their marks in 3 subjects, calculates their average, assigns a grade, and stores their data in a dictionary.

# Function to calculate the average marks and grade
def calculate_grade(average_marks):
    if average_marks >= 90:
        grade = 'A+'
    elif average_marks >= 80:
        grade = 'A'
    elif average_marks >= 70:
        grade = 'B'
    elif average_marks >= 60:
        grade = 'C'
    elif average_marks >= 50:
        grade = 'D'
    else:
        grade = 'F'
    return grade

# Function to get student data and store it in a dictionary
def get_student_data():
    student_data = {}

    # Get student name
    name = input("Enter student's name: ")

    # Get marks in 3 subjects
    marks1 = float(input("Enter marks for subject 1: "))
    marks2 = float(input("Enter marks for subject 2: "))
    marks3 = float(input("Enter marks for subject 3: "))

    # Calculate average marks
    average_marks = (marks1 + marks2 + marks3) / 3

    # Assign grade
    grade = calculate_grade(average_marks)

    # Store data in dictionary
    student_data["Name"] = name
    student_data["Subject 1"] = marks1
    student_data["Subject 2"] = marks2
    student_data["Subject 3"] = marks3
    student_data["Average Marks"] = average_marks
    student_data["Grade"] = grade

    return student_data

# Function to display the report card
def display_report_card(student_data):
    print("\n--- Student Report Card ---")
    print(f"Name: {student_data['Name']}")
    print(f"Marks in Subject 1: {student_data['Subject 1']}")
    print(f"Marks in Subject 2: {student_data['Subject 2']}")
    print(f"Marks in Subject 3: {student_data['Subject 3']}")
    print(f"Average Marks: {student_data['Average Marks']:.2f}")
    print(f"Grade: {student_data['Grade']}")

# Main function to run the program
def main():
    print("Welcome to the Student Report Card System")
    student_data = get_student_data()
    display_report_card(student_data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
