# AI Projects

Welcome to my collection of AI projects! This repository will feature the various projects I work on throughout my AI and Python learning journey. As I progress, I'll be adding new projects, showcasing both theoretical learning and hands-on coding.

## Current Projects

- **Student Report Card System**  
  A simple CLI-based system to input student details, calculate average marks in 3 subjects, assign a grade, and store the data in a dictionary.
  - **Studend Grade Analyzer**
     Input unlimited student records via interactive prompts
    Implements A-F scale using conditional logic
    Calculates individual averages
    Identifies top performer using max() with custom keys
  
  

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Basic Python concepts (functions, loops, conditionals, dictionaries, lists)

Stay tuned for updates as I continue building and adding more projects!
